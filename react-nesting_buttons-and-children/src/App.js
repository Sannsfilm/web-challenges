// For now, there is a Button component in the ./src/App.js which is rendered several times.

// Unfortunately, all buttons show the same text; supposing that different buttons do different things in an application, this is not really a reuseable component.

// Let's use the children prop to make the component more flexible!

// Task
// Switch to the ./src/App.js file and

// in the Button component, receive the children prop as parameter; make sure to destructure it.
// replace the "Click me!" text with the children prop (don't forget the curly braces {}).
// in the App component, change the Button elements from being self-closing to have an opening and closing tag.
// add text of your choice between the opening and closing tags of the Button elements (use different texts to see any difference in the browser!)
// ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you can now use the children prop to create really flexible components!
